Circular linked lists have a "tail" pointer to the last element instead of the usual head pointer to the first.

Just remember to move the trav_pointer to (*tail)->next to start on the first element.

When to stop: when trav_pointer = (*tail)->next, it means the next node is the first (you are currently at the last). But you can't do this check on the first element, or the loop won't start. 

Or use a do-while loop.
